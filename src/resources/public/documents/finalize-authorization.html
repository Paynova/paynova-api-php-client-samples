		      <h1>Finalize Authorization</h1>
		      <p>
		     	After a successful customer payment process (in the payment window), the transaction gets authorized and now needs to be finalized.
		     	The Finalize Authorization service is used to finalize all or part of an authorization. Depending on the payment method used to generate 
		     	the authorization, this service has different effects. See the Paynova API documentation for more information.
		     </p> 
		     <p>
		     	Before Finalize Authorization can take place the following must have occurred:
		     	<ol>
		     		<li>
		     			An order must have been <a href="?service=create-and-init">created and payment initialized</a>
		     		</li>
		     		<li>Customer must have paid using credit card or using other payment method that results in a transaction that needs to be finalized</li>
		     	</ol>
		     </p>
		     <p>
		     	<em>
		     		Note if you get error message from the API server, the transaction might already have been finalized. 
		     		Go to <a href="?service=create-and-init">create order and initialize payment.</a>
		     	</em>
